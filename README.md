# KerbalController
A new repo for the arduino controller written in rust (with bindings to the c++ krpc lib)

# Using it
You need rust, and the krpc c++ library installed (https://krpc.github.io/krpc/cpp/client.html#installing-the-library)
cargo will download all the dependecies you need and compile the bindings if you need any more funcionality.
On macOS mojave you need the lastest headers, before installing any libraries.

LLVM's `clang` is also needed
